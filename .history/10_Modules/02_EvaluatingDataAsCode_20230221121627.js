/*
There are several ways to take data (a string of code) and run it as part of the current program.

The most obvious way is the special operator eval, which will execute a string in the current scope. This is usually a bad idea because it breaks some of the properties that scopes normally have, such as it being easily predictable which binding a given name refers to.

const x = 1
function evalAndReturnX(code) {
  eval(code)
  return x
}

console.log(evalAndReturnX('var x = 2'))
// → 2
console.log(x)
// → 1

// A less scary way of interpreting data as code is to use the Function constructor. It takes two arguments: a string containing a comma-separated list of argument names and a string containing the function body. It wraps the code in a function value so that it gets its own scope and won’t do odd things with other scopes.
let plusOne = Function('n', 'return n + 1;')
console.log(plusOne(4))
// → 5

// This is precisely what we need for a module system. We can wrap the module’s code in a function and use that function’s scope as module scope.
