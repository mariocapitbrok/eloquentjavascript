// If we want to enforce that the match must span the whole string, we can add the markers ^ and $. The caret matches the start of the input string, whereas the dollar sign matches the end. So, /^\d+$/ matches a string consisting entirely of one or more digits, /^!/ matches any string that starts with an exclamation mark, and /x^/ does not match any string (there cannot be an x before the start of the string).

// If, on the other hand, we just want to make sure the date starts and ends on a word boundary, we can use the marker \b. A word boundary can be the start or end of the string or any point in the string that has a word character (as in \w) on one side and a nonword character on the other.

console.log(/cat/.test('concatenate'))
// → true
console.log(/\bcat\b/.test('concatenate'))
// → false
