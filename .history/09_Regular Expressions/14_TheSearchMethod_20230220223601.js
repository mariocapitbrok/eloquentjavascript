// The indexOf method on strings cannot be called with a regular expression. But there is another method, search, that does expect a regular expression. Like indexOf, it returns the first index on which the expression was found, or -1 when it wasn’t found.

console.log('  word'.search(/\S/))
// → 2
console.log('    '.search(/\S/))
// → -1
