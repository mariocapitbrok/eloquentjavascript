// JavaScript has a standard class for representing dates—or, rather, points in time. It is called Date. If you simply create a date object using new, you get the current date and time.
console.log(new Date())
// → Mon Nov 13 2017 16:19:11 GMT+0100 (CET)

// You can also create an object for a specific time.
console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9))
// → Wed Dec 09 2009 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)
console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9, 12, 59, 59, 999))
// → Wed Dec 09 2009 12:59:59 GMT+0100 (CET)

// JavaScript uses a convention where month numbers start at zero (so December is 11), yet day numbers start at one. This is confusing and silly. Be careful.

// The last four arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) are optional and taken to be zero when not given.

// Timestamps are stored as the number of milliseconds since the start of 1970, in the UTC time zone. This follows a convention set by “Unix time”, which was invented around that time. You can use negative numbers for times before 1970. The getTime method on a date object returns this number. It is big, as you can imagine.
console.log(new Date(2013, 11, 19).getTime())
// → 1387407600000
console.log(new Date(1387407600000))
// → Thu Dec 19 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)

// If you give the Date constructor a single argument, that argument is treated as such a millisecond count. You can get the current millisecond count by creating a new Date object and calling getTime on it or by calling the Date.now function.

const currentMilisecond1 = new Date().getTime()
console.log(currentMilisecond1)

const currentMilisecond2 = Date.now()
console.log(currentMilisecond2)

// Date objects provide methods such as getFullYear, getMonth, getDate, getHours, getMinutes, and getSeconds to extract their components. Besides getFullYear there’s also getYear, which gives you the year minus 1900 (98 or 119) and is mostly useless.

// Putting parentheses around the parts of the expression that we are interested in, we can now create a date object from a string.
function getDate(string) {
  let [_, month, day, year] = /(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})/.exec(string)
  return Date(year, month - 1, day)
}
console.log(getDate('1-30-2003'))
// → Thu Jan 30 2003 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET)
