/*
Numbers again
Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must support an optional minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal dot, and exponent notation—5e-3 or 1E10—again with an optional sign in front of the exponent. Also note that it is not necessary for there to be digits in front of or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, .5 and 5. are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn’t.

// Fill in this regular expression.
// let number = /^...$/
let number = /^[+\-]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)([eE][+\-]?\d+)?$/

// Tests:
for (let str of [
  '1',
  '-1',
  '+15',
  '1.55',
  '.5',
  '5.',
  '1.3e2',
  '1E-4',
  '1e+12',
]) {
  if (!number.test(str)) {
    console.log(`Failed to match '${str}'`)
  }
}
for (let str of ['1a', '+-1', '1.2.3', '1+1', '1e4.5', '.5.', '1f5', '.']) {
  if (number.test(str)) {
    console.log(`Incorrectly accepted '${str}'`)
  }
}

I apologize for the confusion. The regular expression I provided still has a problem that it matches a single dot as a valid number. To fix this, we need to modify the regular expression to ensure that there is at least one digit before or after the decimal point. Here's a modified regular expression:

scss
Copy code
let number = /^[+\-]?(?=[.\d])(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.?\d*)(?:[eE][+\-]?\d+)?$/;
Explanation:

^[+\-]? matches an optional plus or minus sign at the start of the string.
(?=[.\d]) is a positive lookahead assertion that requires that the next character is either a dot or a digit. This ensures that the number does not start with a dot.
(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.?\d*) matches a number with at least one digit before or after the decimal point. The first alternative \d*\.?\d+ matches zero or more digits followed by an optional decimal point and one or more digits. The second alternative \d+\.?\d* matches one or more digits followed by an optional decimal point and zero or more digits. The parentheses are used to group the alternatives.
(?:[eE][+\-]?\d+)? is an optional non-capturing group that matches an exponent notation, as in the previous regular expression.
$ matches the end of the string.
With this modified regular expression, the string "." is not matched as a valid number. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses.
