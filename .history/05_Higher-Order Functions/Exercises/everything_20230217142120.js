/*
Everything
Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array. In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is like the && operator.

Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.

function every(array, test) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (!test(array[i])) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
}
