// The indexOf method on strings cannot be called with a regular expression. But there is another method, search, that does expect a regular expression. Like indexOf, it returns the first index on which the expression was found, or -1 when it wasn’t found.

console.log('  word'.search(/\S/))
// → 2
console.log('    '.search(/\S/))
// → -1

// Unfortunately, there is no way to indicate that the match should start at a given offset (like we can with the second argument to indexOf), which would often be useful.
