// It is possible to use replace to write a function that removes all comments from a piece of JavaScript code. Here is a first attempt:
function stripComments(code) {
  return code.replace(/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*\*\//g, '')
}
console.log(stripComments('1 + /* 2 */3'))
// → 1 + 3
console.log(stripComments('x = 10;// ten!'))
// → x = 10;
console.log(stripComments('1 /* a */+/* b */ 1'))
// → 1  1

/*
The part before the or operator matches two slash characters followed by any number of non-newline characters. 

The part for multiline comments is more involved. We use [^] (any character that is not in the empty set of characters) as a way to match any character. We cannot just use a period here because block comments can continue on a new line, and the period character does not match newline characters.

But the output for the last line appears to have gone wrong. Why?

The [^]* part of the expression, as I described in the section on backtracking, will first match as much as it can. If that causes the next part of the pattern to fail, the matcher moves back one character and tries again from there. In the example, the matcher first tries to match the whole rest of the string and then moves back from there. It will find an occurrence of * / after going back four characters and match that. This is not what we wanted—the intention was to match a single comment, not to go all the way to the end of the code and find the end of the last block comment.
*/

// Because of this behavior, we say the repetition operators (+, *, ?, and {}) are greedy, meaning they match as much as they can and backtrack from there.

// If you put a question mark after them (+?, *?, ??, {}?), they become nongreedy and start by matching as little as possible, matching more only when the remaining pattern does not fit the smaller match.

// And that is exactly what we want in this case. By having the star match the smallest stretch of characters that brings us to a */, we consume one block comment and nothing more.
function stripComments(code) {
  return code.replace(/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*?\*\//g, '')
}
console.log(stripComments('1 /* a */+/* b */ 1'))
// → 1 + 1

// A lot of bugs in regular expression programs can be traced to unintentionally using a greedy operator where a nongreedy one would work better. When using a repetition operator, consider the nongreedy variant first.
